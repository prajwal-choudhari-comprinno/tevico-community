CheckTitle: Ensure a log metric filter and alarm exist for AWS Management Console authentication failures

  - CIS AWS Foundations Benchmark
ServiceName: cloudwatch
SubServiceName: logs
ResourceIdTemplate: arn:aws:logs:region:account-id:log-group:log-group-name:*
Severity: medium
ResourceType: AwsCloudWatchLogMetricFilter
Description: Ensure that CloudWatch log metric filters and alarms are configured to detect AWS Management Console authentication failures
Risk: 
  Authentication failures may indicate attempted unauthorized access to AWS resources. Without proper monitoring and alerting, these events could go undetected, potentially leading to security breaches, account compromises, or unauthorized access to sensitive data.

Remediation:
  Code:
    CLI: |
      aws logs put-metric-filter \
        --log-group-name <log-group-name> \
        --filter-name ConsoleAuthFailureFilter \
        --filter-pattern '{ ($.eventName = ConsoleLogin) && ($.errorMessage = "Failed authentication") }' \
        --metric-transformations \
            metricName=ConsoleAuthFailureCount,metricNamespace=CloudTrailMetrics,metricValue=1
