CheckTitle: Ensure VPC security groups restrict access to high-risk ports
CheckType: []
ServiceName: ec2
SubServiceName: ""
ResourceIdTemplate: arn:aws:ec2:region:account-id:security-group/security-group-id
Severity: medium
ResourceType: AwsSecurityGroup
Description: Ensure VPC security groups restrict access to high-risk ports (e.g., SSH, FTP, RDP, database ports).
Risk: If security groups allow unrestricted access to high-risk ports, it could expose resources to unauthorized access, increasing the risk of exploitation and potential data breaches.

  Recommendation:
    Text:
      Ensure that VPC security groups restrict public access (0.0.0.0/0 or ::/0) to high-risk ports. These include ports for administrative access (22, 3389), database services (1433, 1434, 3306, 5432), and other sensitive services. Implement the principle of least privilege by only allowing access from specific IP ranges when necessary.
