Description: Ensure customer managed policies that allow full "*:*" administrative privileges are not created.

Risk: |
  IAM policies are the means by which privileges are granted to users, groups, or roles. 
  It is recommended and considered standard security advice to grant least privilege—that is, 
  granting only the permissions required to perform a task. Determine what users need to do 
  and then craft policies for them that let the users perform only those tasks instead of 
  allowing full administrative privileges. Providing full administrative privileges instead of 
  restricting to the minimum set of permissions exposes the resources to potentially unwanted actions.

  Recommendation:
    Text: |
      It is more secure to start with a minimum set of permissions and grant additional permissions 
      as necessary, rather than starting with permissions that are too lenient and then trying to tighten 
      them later. List policies and analyze if permissions are the least possible to conduct business activities.
